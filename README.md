# Hey, I'm Nicholas üëã

I'm a full-stack developer using tools like [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [React](https://reactjs.org/).<br />

## About ‚úçÔ∏è
I discovered my passion for coding at the age of 14 when I began creating discord bots using JavaScript and Node.js, which helped me grasp the fundamentals of programming. As I progressed, I shifted toward web development, which has become my primary focus.

Additionally, I've experimented with mobile development using Objective-C and Swift. Presently, I have the most experience in TypeScript and React. [Click here to join my community (Discord)](https://notnick.io/community).
