# Hey, I'm Nicholas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 21 year old software engineer located in the United Kingdom. I roughly have around 4 years of experience in web development and I'm familiar with modern web technologies such as React & TypeScript. I'm currently studying Computer Science and I plan to specialize in server-side development in the near future. <br />
