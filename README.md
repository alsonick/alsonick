# Hey, I'm Nicholas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 21 year old software engineer located in the United Kingdom. I roughly have around 4 years of web development experience and am familiar with modern web technologies such as React & TypeScript. I'm studying Computer Science and plan to specialize in server-side development shortly. <br /><br />
I'm also a huge introvert and pretty shy so I prefer solitude but I'm always open to meeting new people with similar interests! If you'd like to chat, please add me on any social media platform.
